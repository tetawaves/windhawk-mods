  always open near the start button.

  open near the tray area and not on the opposite side of the screen.

* Some (hopefully all) system tray icons are no longer rotated sideways.
* The default taskbar width was increased to account for the rotated clock
  width.
* Fixed some cases of disappearing taskbar icons.
* Fixed the position of the Win+X menu (start button right click menu).
* Other small fixes and improvements.

  the taskbar width is increased.
